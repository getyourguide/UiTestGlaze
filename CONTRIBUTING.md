3.	Make any necessary changes to the source code.
4.	Add tests that verify that your contribution works as expected and modify existing tests if required.
5.	Run all unit tests and make sure all of them pass.
6. Once your feature is complete, prepare the commit with appropriate message and the issue number.
7. Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) and wait for the users to review.
